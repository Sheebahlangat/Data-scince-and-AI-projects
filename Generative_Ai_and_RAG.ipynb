            "Suggested Reading One Hundred Years in Solitude by Gabriel Gar cia Marquez Love in the T ime of Cholera by Gabriel Gar cia Marquez. Reprint 2025-26 prose fiction, right from the really short ‘short story’ of about five hundred words to longer and more complex works. The longer ones, with their status of middle length, fall between the tautness of the short narrative and the expansiveness of the novel. There can be thematic variation too. The stories deal with fantasy, reality, alienation and the problem of choice in personal life. There are three short stories and two long ones in this section representing writers from five cultures. under a bright sun, a huge wave picked up several cars that were driving down the avenue along the seawall or parked on the pavement, and embedded one of them in the side of the hotel.\n"
